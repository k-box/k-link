## How it works

The K-Link architecture is based on components:

- The [K-Link Explore site](./docs/website.md), this repository, that gives a human friendly entry-point
- The [K-Link Registry](https://github.com/k-box/k-link-registry) for controlling what applications can access 
  the community and their permission
- The [K-Search API](https://github.com/k-box/k-search), for adding, searching and removing documents
- And the optional [K-Link Video Streaming Service](https://github.com/k-box/k-link-video-streaming) if video playback on Mobile devices is needed
