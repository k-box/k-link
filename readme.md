## Installation

K-Link can be installed on most operating systems. The installation is heavily based on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

### Prerequisites

- Check the [system requirements](./docs/requirements.md).
- Use an operating system [supported by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#server) (ideally GNU/Linux; we use [Debian](https://debian.org))
- Make sure you have installed a recent version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Simplest installation

These few commands allow you to quickly install a K-Link **locally** on your computer for testing purposes.

* Create a directory: `mkdir k-link && cd k-link`
* Download configuration file: `curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k-box/k-link/master/docker-compose.example.yml`
* Start up services: `docker-compose up -d` (running this for the first time, it will download a lot of data and take a while)
* Visit your K-Link Registry: [http://localhost:8181/registry](http://localhost:8181/registry) (you can login to the K-Link Registry with the username `admin` and the password `123456789`.)

For an installation on a server in the Internet or more configuration options, see the documentation on [installation of the K-Link](./docs/installation.md). There you set relevant passwords, which is important when using the Software for any purpose.
